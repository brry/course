[["index.html", "R course welcome", " R course Berry Boessenkool, berry-b@gmx.de welcome to programming with R! I hope learning to code will change your life like it did mine :). Since 2012, I teach R courses with great joy, see brry.github.io. This website is here to help you start your coding journey. My free online courses are fairly suitable to learn programming on your own. Short R intro (ca 1-5 hours) Fundamentals of Programming videos + autograded exercises, slides: Infrastructure (ca 1-3 hours) Python (ca 20-50 hours) R (ca 30-70 hours) German R MOOC (ca 20-50 hours) German Python MOOC (ca 10-40 hours) Feel free to book me as a trainer in addition.

On Linux Mint, replace $(lsb_release -cs) with e.g. jammy or noble, as listed. On Debian, find the link here. sudo echo &quot;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list Check /etc/apt/sources.list manually for the correct link (as referenced above). Make sure there is a / at the end.

Write readable code that is easy to maintain (see below). Use version control with a single source of truth (SSOT). For reports / presentations, use quarto instead of separate files with scripts, Jupyter notebook, images, code outputs, word document. good code clear simple (one job per function) documented performant bug-free well tested The following points are written for R, but apply (in spirit) to Python and other languages as well. See also the Rstudio best practice cheatsheet. organisation / workflow Use Rstudio projects (File -&gt; New project). They set the working directory and manage settings &amp; opened scripts. Never use setwd(): others don’t have that path and neither do you, after rearranging folders. Use relative path names, e.g. read.table(\"datafolder/file.txt\") instead of \"C:/Users/berry/Desktop/Project/datafolder/file.txt\". Put source(\"functions.R\") in your main (quarto) script (see project), or write your own package. code format Follow a style guide consistantly (example). Choose short but descriptive object names. Use expressive verbs for function names. Functions do something. Functions should call each other, instead of being one big multi-purpose monster. Use Rstudio script sections \\# 1 clean data ---- for an outline (CTRL+SHIFT+O). Use line breaks (with indentation) to avoid horizontal scrolling (margin settings). code quality Vectorize code whenever possible. If not, use lapply/sapply instead of for loops (lesson 4.3 and 8.3). DRY: don’t repeat yourself. Write defensive code that checks inputs (lesson 8.1). Use arrays for all-numeric data (lesson 4.4). Do not load &gt;2 packages from the library, instead use pack::fun. Install packages conditionally. Do not create more objects than needed, clean up with rm. Make sure your code runs in a clean session: CTRL+SHIFT+F10 to restart R with a clean workspace (Rdata settings) source() the entire script with CTRL+SHIFT+S. To practice writing good R code, improve the examples in elegant code.

"],["packages.html", "packages", " packages usage Whenever possible, use pack::fun() instead of library(\"pack\") ; fun(). It makes clear from wich package ‘fun’ is used. Otherwise, when multiple packages have fun, the one from the lastly loaded package will be used. And that might not be the one you expect. When you use multiple functions from a package, the second option is fine of course. installation Installing add-on R packages usually is easy from within R (and works without admin rights): install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) For potential installation issues, see below. At the top of a script, conditionally install all needed packages. For a single package, you could use if(!requireNamespace(&quot;berryFunctions&quot;, quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;berryFunctions&quot;) To depend on a certain development version, use if(packageVersion(&quot;berryFunctions&quot;) &lt; &quot;1.19.3&quot;) { if(!requireNamespace(&quot;remotes&quot;, quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;brry/berryFunctions&quot;) } When using several packages, use if(!requireNamespace(&quot;pacman&quot;, quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;pacman&quot;) pacman::p_load(&quot;berryFunctions&quot;, &quot;rdwd&quot;) issues Here are solutions to some issues I have encountered in the past while installing packages with external (i.e. non-R) dependencies. rJava on Windows Check if Java is available. There should be no errors when running (in R): install.packages(&quot;rJava&quot;) ; library(rJava) If necessary, install Java in the same bit-version as R (eg 64bit). The Java binary file must be on the search path, which will normally happen automatically. In case you run into the 32/64 bits error: “JAVA_HOME cannot be determined from the Registry”, try installing the package with no multiarchitecture support, e.g.: remotes::install_github(\"brry/OSMscale\", build_opts=\"--no-multiarch\") rJava on Linux Open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and paste (CTRL+SHIFT+V) all lower-cased: sudo apt-get install r-cran-rjava Here’s the list of other supported packages using this mechanism. You might first have to run something like (source): sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+ sf If install.packages(\"sf\") on Linux does not work, you can try the following: sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gdal-bin sudo apt install libgdal-dev libproj-dev See also thinkr.fr on R4 on Ubuntu 20.04 gdal Probably obsolete with the retirement of rgdal, but just for reference: sudo apt update sudo apt install libgdal-dev libproj-dev source If you cannot install a package, you might be able to source some functions. Download the package zip folder on github (see git) and then run: Vectorize(source)(dir(&quot;unzipped_package_path/R&quot;, full=TRUE)) This creates all R functions as objects in your globalenv workspace (and overwrites existing objects of the same name!). "],["git.html", "git", " git git is a version control software.
