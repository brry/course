This is a fake dataset created by Berry Boessenkool.
It features common data formats that are still easy to read by R.
Almost all it needs are settings to the read.table family of commands.

Remember to never change raw data!
Rather have R read it for you, keep a script of potential cleanups and save a clean version of the data alongside the orginal.
