# welcome

<img src="https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/externalfig/Blogo.png" width="100">

This website provides instructions to get started with R.  
It serves as a companion for courses I teach, see [brry.github.io](https://brry.github.io).  
The source code is available at [github.com/brry/course](https://github.com/brry/course),
specifically the [website](https://github.com/brry/course/tree/master/website) folder.

In case the table of content on the left is not shown, click the four bars.

_Pro tip: the arrow left/right keys jump between chapters._


# slides

Here are the slides in several versions:

* [handout](https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/RcourseBerry.pdf) (one pdf page per slide)
* [presentation](https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/RcourseBerry%20pres.pdf)
(animated with LaTeX \\onslide et al.)
* [source code](https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/RcourseBerry.Rnw) (.Rnw, I suggest rightclick - save as)


The presentation template is available through
[`berryFunctions::createPres()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/berryFunctions/topics/createPres?).

### datasets

You can [download all datasets](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/brry/course/tree/master/data) or the [complete course repository](https://github.com/brry/course/archive/master.zip) at once.  

I suggest to rather install [git](#git) and clone the repo [github.com/brry/course](https://github.com/brry/course).  
Then a single click on `Pull` in Rstudio's git tab wil yield an updated version of all materials.



# install

First install R itself and then Rstudio:

* R itself
  * R on **Windows**: [current R install.exe](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) (update through [installr](https://github.com/talgalili/installr/blob/master/README.md))
  * R on **Mac**: follow e.g. these instructions: https://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-on-os-x
  * R on **Linux Ubuntu**: See instructions below  
* **Rstudio on all platforms**: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>

To enhance reproducibility, I suggest to change some Rstudio [settings](#settings).

### Linux

**Installing R on Linux Ubuntu** so that `sudo apt upgrade` updates to the latest R version if outdated 
(idea from [Kris Eberwein](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-on-linux-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus) and [Dean Attali](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-r-on-ubuntu-14-04)):  
Open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and paste (CTRL+SHIFT+V) the following lines.  
Replace `focal` with e.g. `bionic` if you have another Ubuntu version (check in shell with `lsb_release -a`  ):  
20.04 focal-cran40  
19.10 eoan-cran35  
18.04 bionic-cran40  
16.04 xenial-cran40  
14.04 trusty-cran35  
[Current list](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/)

<pre>
sudo echo "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu <b>focal-cran40</b>/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
</pre>

### GPG

In case you run into GPG problems like the example below, try replacing both gpg lines with the single line 
([idea source](https://superuser.com/questions/620765/sudo-apt-key-adv-keyserver-keyserver-ubuntu-com-recv-7f0ceb10-command-return)):
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv E084DAB9
```

*gpg: requesting key E084DAB9 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com  
?: keyserver.ubuntu.com: No route to host  
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: No route to host  
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.  
gpg: Total number processed: 0  
gpg: keyserver communications error: keyserver unreachable  
gpg: keyserver communications error: public key not found  
gpg: keyserver receive failed: public key not found*



# settings

Rstudio settings I suggest to change for reproducibility and compatibility:

- Tools - Global Options - General
    - **OFF**: Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup  
    - Save workspace to .RData on exit: **NEVER**  
Instead use `save(object, file="object.Rdata")` after long computations.  
You can load them later with `load("object.Rdata")`.
    - **ON**: Restore previously open source documents at startup  
- Tools - Global Options - Code - Display
    - **ON**: Show margin (Margin column:80)  *People hate horizontal scrolling!*
    - **ON**: Highlight R function calls
- Tools - Global Options - Code - Saving
    - Line ending conversion: **Windows (CR/LF)**
    - Default Text Encoding: **UTF-8**
- Tools - Global Options - Sweave
    - Weave Rnw files using: **knitr**
- Tools - Modify Keyboard Shortcuts
    - remove `CTRL+Y` from the command "paste last yank" (if you want it to mean "redo" as in other programs)
    - Set Working Directory to Current Document's Directory: `CTRL + H`
- For more keyboard shortcuts, see [rskey](https://github.com/brry/rskey#rskey)



# git

git is a version control software. Even if you do not yet plan to use it actively, it will make updating the course material a lot easier.

### install git

This is tedious, but needs to be done only once.

- Create a github account at <https://github.com/join>
- Download and install git, see <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Connect git to Rstudio: (instructions [with screenshots](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github))
  - RStudio -> Tools -> Version Control: select Git.
  - RStudio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN: Ensure the path to the Git executable is correct.
  - `Create RSA Key`, close window
  - `View public key`: copy the displayed public key
  - go to <https://github.com/settings/keys> and click `New SSH key`, paste the public key
  - RStudio -> Tools -> Shell: type the following:
```
git version # just to see git works fine
git config --global user.email "YourEmail@domain.com"
git config --global user.name "YourUserNameHere"
```


### use git

To clone a git repo, Rstudio handles most the work for you.

- 1. Go to [github.com/brry/course](https://github.com/brry/course) - <span style="background-color:lime">Code</span> - Copy URL

![](https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/externalfig/git_clone_1.PNG)


- 2. At Rstudio - File - New Project - Version Control - Git,  
paste the repository URL, set the subdirectory and create project.  
_I recommend to keep the Project directory name so local and github folder names match exactly._

![](https://github.com/brry/course/raw/master/externalfig/git_clone_Rstudio.png) 

- 3. From now on, get the latest version of my slides with a single click on `Pull`:

# packages

Installing add-on R packages usually is easy from within R (and works without admin rights):
```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
On Linux, some packages with external dependencies (like rJava) can be more difficult.  
In such cases, you can often open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and paste (CTRL+SHIFT+V)  
`sudo apt-get install r-cran-rjava` (all lower-cased).  
Here's the [official information](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html#supported-packages) on this topic.

Installing the `sf` package for spatial data is a bit tricky on Linux because it needs a recent version of gdal. 
If `install.packages("sf")` does not work, you can try the following:
```
sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
sudo apt install libgdal-dev libproj-dev
```


# sumatra

I like to use sumatra PDF viewer as the default viewer.  
It doesn't lock files from editing, hence currently opened files can be changed (e.g. by R).

It comes in `Rstudio/bin/sumatra` and I like to change some [settings](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/settings.html).  

### with R

```{r sumatrainit, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("berryFunctions")
# needs packageVersion("berryFunctions")  > 1.19.3 :
remotes::install_github("brry/berryFunctions") 

berryFunctions::sumatraInitialize()
```


### manually

_Since June 2020, on my machine settings are stored in e.g. `C:/Users/berry/AppData/Roaming/SumatraPDF`, hence the following might no longer work._

Open `Rstudio/bin/sumatra/sumatrapdfrestrict.ini` and set 

* `SavePreferences = 1`  
* `FullscreenAccess = 1`

Open and close a pdf, so that `Rstudio/bin/sumatra/SumatraPDF-settings.txt` will be created.  
Now change the following entries:

* `DefaultZoom = fit page` (probably already the default)
* `ShowToc = 0`
* `DefaultDisplayMode = single page`

# project

These are some instructions to start an R research project under version control.

- install [R, Rstudio](#install) and [git](#git) 
- create a new github repository (<https://github.com/new>), initialize with Readme
- `Code` -> Copy URL
- Rstudio -> File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git: paste URL, set subdirectory, create project.
- Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R script / R markdown
- follow [good practices](#good-practice)
- Work, then commit changes and push to github


# good practice

I review a lot of code from students, clients or colleagues and keep giving the same basic recommendations over and over again.  
Now I collect important things here so I can easily point to them. Expect this to be expanded :).

### source scripts
Before you send someone any code whatsoever, do the following:

- `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`F10` to restart R with a clean workspace. Remember to have the Rstudio [settings](#settings) at `Tools - Global Options - General` set to: _Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup_ **OFF** and _Save workspace to .RData on exit_ **NEVER**
- copy the script to some other folder than your working place
- `source()` the entire script with `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`S`
- If something fails, fix it! (e.g. stop messing with `setwd`, copy data files to be read, rename all instances of a renamed object, ...)
- Only now send the file (or folder with data files etc. alongside the script as zip file)


### Rproj

- Use Rstudio projects.  
- Never use `setwd()` because others won't have that exact path.  
  Even you yourself might not, after rearranging folders.  
- Use relative path names, e.g. `read.table("datafolder/file.txt")` instead of `"C:/Users/berry/Desktop/Project/datafolder/file.txt"`


### packages

At the top of the script, conditionally install all needed packages.

For a single package, you could use
```{r packinst, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("berryFunctions", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("berryFunctions")
```

To depend on a certain development version, use
```{r packver, eval=FALSE}
if(packageVersion("berryFunctions") < "1.19.3")
  {
  if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("brry/berryFunctions")
  }
```

When using several packages, use
```{r packman, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load("berryFunctions", "rdwd")
```

Whenever possible, use `pack::fun()` instead of `library("pack") ; fun()`.
It makes clear from wich package 'fun' is used.   
Otherwise, when multiple packages have `fun`, the one from the lastly loaded package will be used. 
And that might not be the one you expect.  
When you use multiple functions from a package, the second option is fine of course.
